# Partnership Podcast - Natural Language Processing

## Objective
Complete the assigned partnership podcast project for CIS class.

## Motivation
We chose Natural Language Processing as our topic for the project because of its ability to automate communication, drastically reducing the amount of time and resources spent on things such as help desks, customer support, and pretty much anything you can think. Practically everyone needs to communicate, so the demand for tasks involving communication will always exceed the supply, unless there exists some form of automated communication.
